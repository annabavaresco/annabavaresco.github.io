position: "Student Collaborator"
time: Feb 2021-Sep 2022
place: "International Mobility Office of the University of Trento"
description: >-
  My job was to officially nominate outgoing Erasmus students 
                    and trainees to the partner universities, to prepare their financial agreements, and to accompany 
                    incoming international students during their appointments at the immigration office. I found
                    this job very enriching, as it gave me the opportunity to meet many international students and, at the same time,
                    do somehting useful for my fellow Unitn students.
